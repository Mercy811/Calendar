Creative part:
1. Users can tag an event with a particular category and enable/disable those tags in the calendar view. 
2. Highlight current day
3. Display events in corresponding table cell 
4. Urgent reminder for events in 2 hours from current time


-1: Month and year do not change when going to different month, -2: Events cannot be edited, and sends user to log in when creating, deleting, editing. -3: Session cookies are not Http only, -2: Doesn't pass html validation, -8: Creative portion insignificant, and features do not work (wrong current day)
